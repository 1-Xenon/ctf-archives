My friend Timmy told me about this cool encryption! What is it behind this message?

Hint: A ROT Encryption

# Solution
Opening up the message I saw the following:
```$%p}sr~}LE_52J0x0=62C?E023@FE0#~%cfPPPN```

Since the hint has said it is a ROT encryption, I used cyberchef.io to help me to decrypt this message. 
We then find that the encryption method used is ROT47 which allows us to get the flag
