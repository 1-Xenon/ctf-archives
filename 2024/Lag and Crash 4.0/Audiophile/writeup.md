## Writeup
Opening up the text file, we see the following:
```https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgQjno_WN3iOjXe5ywVQ0zcjYiq5?e=cHDa33```

which redirects us to an .wav file. The very first thing I did was to listen to the contents of the file and in the first 5 seconds, I notice that something was off with the audio. I then downloaded the file and placed it into Audacity to review the audio.
